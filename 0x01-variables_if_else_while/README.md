***0-positive_or_negative.c*** - a c program that prints out whether a generated random number is positive or negative.

***1-last_digit.c*** - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.

> The output of the program will be:
> The string Last digit of, followed by
> n, followed by
> the string is, followed by
> if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
> if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
> if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
> followed by a new line

***2-print_alphabet.c*** - a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

> Only putchar function is used.
> putchar is used only twice in the code.

***3-print_alphabets.c*** - a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line

> Only putchar function is used.
> putchar is used only three times in the code.

***4-print_alphabt.c*** - a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

> Prints all the letters except q and e.
> Only putchar function is used. 
 putchar is used only twice in the code

***5-print_numbers.c*** - a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

***6-print_numberz.c*** - a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

***100-print_comb3.c*** - a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

> Numbers are separated by , followed by a space.
> The two digits are be different.
> 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1.
> Only the smallest combination of two digits are printed.
> Numbers are printed in ascending order, with two digits.
> Only putchar function is used.
> putchar is used only five times in the code.

***101-print_comb4.c*** - a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.

> Numbers are separated by , followed by a space
> The three digits are different.
> 012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2.
> Only the smallest combination of three digits are printed.

> Only putchar function is used.
> No variable type char is used.
> putchar is used only six times in the code.



***102-print_comb5.c*** - a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.

> The numbers range from 0 - 99.
> The two numbers are separated by a space.
> All numbers are printed with two digits. 1 is printed as 01.
> The combination of numbers are separated by comma, followed by a space.
> The combinations of numbers are printed in ascending order.
